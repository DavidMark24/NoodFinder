How often are you at your wits end, trying to decide what to eat for your next meal? In this modern day and age, picking what to eat next should be as easy as clicking yes or no. With Only Foods, you get exactly that. With similar mechanics to most modern dating apps, simply select your choice of Dine In or Eat Out, and run through the prompts until you find something you like.

Whatever option you choose, you'll be presented with a Cuisine page, where you can flip through our library of Cultural Genres, and select whichever type you're in the mood for. If you selected Dine In, you'll be tasked with selecting a meal type, or sub-genre, and finally you'll be presented with 50 recipes to choose from. Reject the stuff you don't want by hitting the salmon sushi X mark. Not feeling any of them? Hit the Only Foods logo in the top left and start again. 

Decide you want to Eat Out instead? No problem -- after you select your Genre, just enter your location and be presented with 50 nearby restaurants, phone number and address included. Save your favorite recipes or restaurants by hitting the green checkmark. Want to scroll through your favorites? Hit the onigiri rice roll in the top right corner to view your saved Recipes and Eateries. 

We wanted to make our application as user friendly as possible, just straight forward intuitive and clean design, inside and out. Project 3 was truly the dream team. React truly facilitates iterative development in a collaborative environment. We had few, if any, issues or conflicts within our code because our communication levels were outstanding. Because of the way our application was planned out, the back end team was able to split the work almost directly down the middle, and each developer exceeded our initial expectations. Ankush set up the Recipe API, as well as the authentication and error handling. David set up the Restaurant/Yelp API and most importantly, gave us our application name, because we really are just about food. Megan and Jessilin tackled the front end together, with Megan setting up the animations and styling that Jessilin established in a wire frame (approved by the entire team, of course).

Truly the best time all around. We worked hard from the beginning and got a lot done, which allowed us to take it easy on days when we maybe were feeling at 100%, but only collectively, not individually. We cheered each other on, helped when we were able, and always kept a light hearted attitude because hustle culture is dead. Thanks to this attitude, much of the focus was kept on learning new skills, and incrementally improving the functionality, instead of panicking and throwing something together at the last minute.

We all very much enjoyed the experience, and have already discussed being open and willing to working together again should the opportunity present itself. And hopefully it does.
